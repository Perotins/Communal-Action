# Welcome to Communal Action's configuration.yml file!
# If you need any assistance, I am very reachable over Spigot!


# Should Communal Action allow players to punish themselves?
punish-self: false

# must be a multiple of 9, size of the inventory shown when doing /ca
inventory-size: 27

# name of the inventory
inventory-title: "Chose a punishment for $player$!"

# Should we broadcast whenever a player has been voted to be punished? Note, this can lead to people "bandwagoning" and voting for the fun of it.
# All votes are logged and I encourage you to track down people who vote without evidence and punish them yourselves.
broadcast-on-vote: false

# If you set the above message to true, then this is the message sent whenever a vote is casted.
# If you have the above set to false, then skip over this.
broadcast-message: "&e$player$ &chas $number$ vote to be $type$!"


# WARNING: This is where the core configurations of Communal Action come into play! Bear with me here.
# There are a few ways for Communal Action to decide when a vote should end
# The first is after a certain amount of votes is reached (i/e 5 votes and action takes place)
# The second is that a % of the online players have voted (i/e 50% of the server voted)

# So after reading the two choices above, how do you configure it to your liking?
# If you want it to use percentages, you would do "50%". Make sure to include the percentage sign!
# If you want it to go by player count only, then just include the number i/e 5 players
# The command portion is the command that you want Communal Action to run when voted
# The broadcast option is if the plugin should broadcast to the entire server than <player> is being voted to be <muted/jailed/kicked>
# The inventory title and inventory slot pertain to the main inventory
# The name part is how the plugin recognizes this form of punishment, so leave it plain and simple without chatcolors etc
# The name section is put in the $type$ in the broadcast-message string above.
# The material part also pertains to the inventory, to see all valid materials see this link https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/spigot/org/bukkit/Material.html


# NOTE! If you use percentages and generally have a low amount of players online, this could mean that one player could mute/jail/kick someone
# All by themselves. I'd generally say to use plain numbers, but it is up to you.
